   * @param overwrite whether to overwrite when the target file already exists, otherwise, they
   *   will be skipped when the group or its children to be moved already exist.
   * @param followLinks if encounter a symbolic link and the value is `true`, then moves the link
   *   final target, otherwise moves the symbolic link itself.
   * @param filter if the argument [recursively] is `true`, can filter to exclude some children
